# sw_enauto_prep

I created this software to prepare myselft for CISCO ENAUTO exam. You can run the software by running the enauto_gui_ebo.py file. 

It should open a GUI window with 4 options:
1) IOS XE
2) DNAC
3) SD WAN
4) MERAKI

Each one has menus and requests to send to each sandbox.

I also upload a pdf file (READ ME PRESENTATION - SOFTWARE ENAUTO PREP EBO) for better understinding of the code. 

I have to mention I didn't write this code with error prevents because its objetive was to prepare myself for an exam and no for an enterprice solution.

I also have to mention that my native language is spanish, so there are some comments or even instructions in spanish but I think it is easy to understand the logic of the code

I hope it can help you for your preparation as it helped me.

Regards
